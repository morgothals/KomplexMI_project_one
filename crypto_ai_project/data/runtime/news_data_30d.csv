2025-11-27 09:50:18+00:00,reddit_CryptoCurrency,[AMA] ETH Strategy - Wartime Ethereum,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hello <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/"">r/CryptoCurrency</a>! ETH Strategy is an onchain protocol that accumulates ETH. We have about 12,000 ETH so far, making us one of the largest ETH treasury companies, our major point of differentiation is being completely onchain. </p> <p>To simplify a complicated protocol, we want to build the best long-term leveraged bet on Ethereum. We believe ETH is going to 10k and we want to structure a trade to take advantage of that. </p> <p>The other half of the protocol is to provide downside-protected yield to people who want to farm crypto's volatility without being exposed to price. </p> <p>I am stableshaman on Twitter I love Defi, in particular lending and stablecoins (obviously). I will pass on questions to our other team members: </p> <p>Cloutedmind, Econdegen, Napenjoyer and 0xTex</p> <p>We would love to answer any questions about ETH Strategy, Defi or in particular options, as structured options trades are a hyper-fixation for the team. </p> <p>Super excited, ask away! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/Shaman_ETH_Strategy""> /u/Shaman_ETH_Strategy </a> <br /> <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p7ycjr/ama_eth_strategy_wartime_ethereum/"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p7ycjr/ama_eth_strategy_wartime_ethereum/"">[comments]</a></span>",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p7ycjr/ama_eth_strategy_wartime_ethereum/

2025-11-29 03:09:59+00:00,reddit_CryptoCurrency,Some whale just dropped $84 million on a Bitcoin long position and everyone’s talking about it.,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>A trader that on chain analyst The Data Nerd spotted just opened a massive BTC long on Hyperliquid.... about $84.19 million with 3x leverage. That’s not pocket change, that’s serious conviction that Bitcoin is heading up.</p> <p>What makes this interesting is the timing. Bitcoin is sitting around the low $90k range right now and has been pretty volatile lately. This trader is basically betting big that we’re going to see higher prices soon. The position uses leverage too, which means the gains could be huge but so could the losses if things go south.</p> <p>The market has definitely been heating up. Daily BTC trading volume is in the high tens of billions of dollars right now, so there’s clearly a lot of activity and interest. Between whales, derivatives and bigger players still taking directional bets, there’s plenty of fuel for more volatility in both directions.</p> <p>These kinds of whale moves usually create ripple effects. Other traders see this and it ends up influencing their decisions – sometimes it brings in more buyers, sometimes it just adds even more chaos to the price action.</p> <p>Personally I think it’s wild to see someone throw that much money on a leveraged bet. One wrong move and that’s a massive liquidation. But clearly some people are still comfortable taking huge swings at these levels.</p> <p>Anyone else watching this play out What do you think happens next with Bitcoin</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/Gullible-Tale9114""> /u/Gullible-Tale9114 </a> <br /> <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p9e3e6/some_whale_just_dropped_84_million_on_a_bitcoin/"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p9e3e6/some_whale_just_dropped_84_million_on_a_bitcoin/"">[comments]</a></span>",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p9e3e6/some_whale_just_dropped_84_million_on_a_bitcoin/
2025-11-29 03:21:42+00:00,reddit_CryptoCurrency,How Bitcoin turned its “strongest month” into its worst in 7 years...,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Bitcoin is having one of its worst Novembers since the 2018 bear market and here’s why it’s happening.</p> <p>So far this month, Bitcoin is down roughly 17–20%, trading around the $90–92k range. That’s pretty close to the losses from November 2019, when BTC dropped about 17–18%. The worst November on record was back in 2018, with a brutal ~36% crash in the middle of that bear market.</p> <p>Historically, November has actually been one of Bitcoin’s strongest months, with average returns around 40% in past cycles, so this kind of red November is a big break from the usual pattern. One major structural change this time around is that U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs finally launched in January 2024, which pulled a lot of institutional money directly into BTC and may have shifted the timing of the typical post-halving “euphoria” phase.</p> <p>Since those ETFs went live, institutions and large funds have played a much bigger role in price action, and a lot of analysts think that’s changed the rhythm of this cycle. Instead of the classic script where October and November often rip higher, this year October already closed slightly red and November is now deeply negative despite that historically bullish seasonality.</p> <p>Another huge factor has been leverage getting nuked. A ton of traders were running oversized long positions with borrowed money, and when the October and November sell-offs hit, billions of dollars in longs were force-liquidated. That cascade of liquidations amplified the downside and helped drive BTC from an all-time high around $126k in October down into the low $80ks at the worst point of this drawdown.</p> <p>Some analysts actually see this “flush” as a necessary cleansing process. It shakes out over-leveraged players and weak hands, kills off some of the froth, and can set up a healthier base for the next leg up once the market digests all the forced selling.</p> <p>One interesting pattern from the last decade: every time Bitcoin has had a red November, December has also finished red. That doesn’t guarantee anything, but if that pattern holds and you combine it with the usual post-halving correction, it wouldn’t be shocking if real recovery takes time and stretches well into 2026 rather than bouncing straight back in the next few weeks</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/hodorrny""> /u/hodorrny </a> <br /> <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p9ebti/how_bitcoin_turned_its_strongest_month_into_its/"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p9ebti/how_bitcoin_turned_its_strongest_month_into_its/"">[comments]</a></span>",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p9ebti/how_bitcoin_turned_its_strongest_month_into_its/

They underpin much of the crypto economy, serving as payment rails and a tool for moving money across borders. USDT is the largest stablecoin, followed by USDC.</p> <p>Total stablecoin market capitalization reached $300 billion in September, a 75% increase from a year earlier and its only getting bigger with Stable blockchain purpose-built for stablecoin payments with consistent performance, predictable fees, and sub-second finality. It has how reached a milestone etting listed n top platforms like Bitget and the others with events like Launchpools.</p> <p>Wall Street giant Citi (C) said the stablecoin market is growing faster than expected. This prompted the bank to recently lift its 2030 forecast for issuance to $1.9 trillion in its base case and $4 trillion in a bull case, up from $1.6 trillion and $3.7 trillion, respectively.</p> <p>“Tokenized deposits transform the banking system into programmable infrastructure.
