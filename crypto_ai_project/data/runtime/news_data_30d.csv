2025-11-27 09:50:18+00:00,reddit_CryptoCurrency,[AMA] ETH Strategy - Wartime Ethereum,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hello <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/"">r/CryptoCurrency</a>! ETH Strategy is an onchain protocol that accumulates ETH. We have about 12,000 ETH so far, making us one of the largest ETH treasury companies, our major point of differentiation is being completely onchain. </p> <p>To simplify a complicated protocol, we want to build the best long-term leveraged bet on Ethereum. We believe ETH is going to 10k and we want to structure a trade to take advantage of that. </p> <p>The other half of the protocol is to provide downside-protected yield to people who want to farm crypto's volatility without being exposed to price. </p> <p>I am stableshaman on Twitter I love Defi, in particular lending and stablecoins (obviously). I will pass on questions to our other team members: </p> <p>Cloutedmind, Econdegen, Napenjoyer and 0xTex</p> <p>We would love to answer any questions about ETH Strategy, Defi or in particular options, as structured options trades are a hyper-fixation for the team. </p> <p>Super excited, ask away! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/Shaman_ETH_Strategy""> /u/Shaman_ETH_Strategy </a> <br /> <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p7ycjr/ama_eth_strategy_wartime_ethereum/"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p7ycjr/ama_eth_strategy_wartime_ethereum/"">[comments]</a></span>",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p7ycjr/ama_eth_strategy_wartime_ethereum/

2025-11-28 19:25:03+00:00,reddit_CryptoCurrency,"To truly ""Be Your Own Bank,"" you must trust your code, not your vendor.","<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>We love to scream &quot;Be Your Own Bank,&quot; but most of us are hypocrites. We trust Coinbase to buy, Exodus to view, and we blindly trust that a Trezor or Ledger firmware update isn't going to leak our keys. We are still a slave to the &quot;big man.&quot; We simply swapped a banker for a developer we've never met. </p> <p>That's why I built the controversial <a href=""http://brainwallet.io"">brainwallet.io</a> 10 years ago (no reports of stolen or lost funds yet). I needed a tool that genereted keys that I could trust. What better way than to create your own simple tool.</p> <p>I just released a new version today which adds support for ETH and the Argon2id KDF. The security parameters are now aggressively memory-hard: 384MB RAM and 25 iterations. It takes my MacBook 12 seconds just to generate a single key pair. This intentional slowness, along with the mandatory salt, makes brute-forcing mathematically infeasible.</p> <p>This is my open-source contribution to the community: a verifiable, memory-hard option for those who truly believe in the &quot;Don't Trust, Verify&quot; ethos. Take it or leave it. I welcome anyone to audit the code to verify the security and the cryptographic parameters.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/unchikuso""> /u/unchikuso </a> <br /> <span><a href=""https://brainwallet.io"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p93o91/to_truly_be_your_own_bank_you_must_trust_your/"">[comments]</a></span>",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p93o91/to_truly_be_your_own_bank_you_must_trust_your/
