2025-11-27 09:50:18+00:00,reddit_CryptoCurrency,[AMA] ETH Strategy - Wartime Ethereum,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hello <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/"">r/CryptoCurrency</a>! ETH Strategy is an onchain protocol that accumulates ETH. We have about 12,000 ETH so far, making us one of the largest ETH treasury companies, our major point of differentiation is being completely onchain. </p> <p>To simplify a complicated protocol, we want to build the best long-term leveraged bet on Ethereum. We believe ETH is going to 10k and we want to structure a trade to take advantage of that. </p> <p>The other half of the protocol is to provide downside-protected yield to people who want to farm crypto's volatility without being exposed to price. </p> <p>I am stableshaman on Twitter I love Defi, in particular lending and stablecoins (obviously). I will pass on questions to our other team members: </p> <p>Cloutedmind, Econdegen, Napenjoyer and 0xTex</p> <p>We would love to answer any questions about ETH Strategy, Defi or in particular options, as structured options trades are a hyper-fixation for the team. </p> <p>Super excited, ask away! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/Shaman_ETH_Strategy""> /u/Shaman_ETH_Strategy </a> <br /> <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p7ycjr/ama_eth_strategy_wartime_ethereum/"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p7ycjr/ama_eth_strategy_wartime_ethereum/"">[comments]</a></span>",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p7ycjr/ama_eth_strategy_wartime_ethereum/

2025-11-28 05:46:43+00:00,reddit_CryptoCurrency,Blockchain in Governments,"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>So I've always had this question, which is also sorta related to CBDCs in general.</p> <p>If a blockchain or distributed ledger system is inherently trustless, how does a Government Blockchain even work? How do transactions made there or data submitted there become tamper-proof? If I remember correctly, Estonia did this already supposedly, but I'm still looking into that.</p> <p>I mean, if the government controls the blockchain, we the public don't have a way to have a say in verifying the transactions, then there's no point to it being transparent or immutable since they can change it if they want to. Then how is it any different from a government digital website? I would understand if they would use another well established chain out there now, but a government would never let a third party control their transactions. They have to make a permissioned blockchain rather than one open to the public.</p> <p>I just don't see any way a government blockchain is compatible with the vision of what a blockchain or crypto should be. Government blockchains are just a selling point, since they don't make transactions immutable or transparent at all. The government can change it anytime they want, like how they envisioned CBDCs to be.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/mitcher991""> /u/mitcher991 </a> <br /> <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p8n4q2/blockchain_in_governments/"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p8n4q2/blockchain_in_governments/"">[comments]</a></span>",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p8n4q2/blockchain_in_governments/

This visionary policy positions Thailand as a serious contender in the global race for crypto dominance, inviting both local enthusiasts and international investors to explore the burgeoning digital asset landscape without the burden of steep taxes.</p> <p>For crypto investors looking for fertile ground, Thailand’s initiative is a beacon, signaling a new dawn for digital investment in Southeast Asia. Other Asian based CEXs like Bitget are also making strides providing tokenized US stocks and RWA onchain for users to trade... they added other initiatives like Bitget lucky scratch for users to win 777 USDT and BGB which has also boosted trading activities</p> <p>Overall, Thailand's innovative tax exemption is more than just a local initiative; it has the potential to resonate on the global stage. Other countries observing Thailand may realize the importance of crafting flexible regulations that can adapt to rapid changes in the crypto landscape. As nations evaluate their own approaches to cryptocurrency, Thailand's proactive stance might act as a catalyst for a sweeping rethinking of tax structures and regulatory frameworks worldwide, as jurisdictions strive to attract investment in this volatile but promising market.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/LavishlyRitzyy""> /u/LavishlyRitzyy </a> <br /> <span><a href=""https://www.onesafe.io/blog/thailand-crypto-tax-exemption"">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p8ngam/thailand_0_capital_gains_tax_emerges_as_a_new/"">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1p8ngam/thailand_0_capital_gains_tax_emerges_as_a_new/
